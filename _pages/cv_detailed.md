### **Education Experience**

September 2005 – June 2011  **Jiashan Experimental Primary School**

September 2011 – June 2014  **Nanhu School Affiliated To Beijing Normal University**

September 2014 – June 2017  **Jiaxing Nanhu High School Affiliated To Beijing Normal University**

April 2017 – March 2018  **Ikushu International Language Academy, major in Japanese**

April 2018 – March 2022  **Bachelor of Science, Nara Women's University**

Mathematic course, Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Faculty of Science

**Major in Mathematics (Topology, Algebra, Calculus, etc.)**

- Research:
    - No undergraduate thesis was produced due to departmental policy; instead, I focused on reading seminars of advanced textbooks in my lab and on self-directed study. Rather than pursuing an application-specific project, I developed core strengths—mathematical rigor, logical reasoning, and implementation skills—as well as the ability to independently catch up in unfamiliar domains.
    - Built a solid foundation in Python and trained to understand deep learning algorithms at the mathematical level and implement them in code (reading seminar on *Deep Learning from Scratch*).
    - From my sophomore year, voluntarily joined a reading group in another lab (master’s program) and systematically studied machine learning theory through C. M. Bishop’s *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML)*.

April 2022 – Mar 2024 **Master’s-equivalent completion, Kyoto University,** Graduate School of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability (five-year doctoral program), 

- **Master’s-equivalent (QE) Research | COVID-19 & Fertility (Japan, 2015–2022)**
    - Title: Factor Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic’s Impact on Japan’s Fertility Rate: Time-Series and Prefecture-Level Correlation Analyses Using Epidemic Waves and Economic Indicators (2015–2022)
    - Integrated Japanese vital statistics with COVID-19 case counts and prefectural economic indicators (e.g., per-capita income) and conducted seasonally adjusted time-series and regional comparative analyses. Identified a clear lagged association in which birth counts decreased significantly ~9 months after major epidemic waves (notably Waves 1, 4, and 6). Found that declines in per-capita prefectural income were significantly associated with reduced births, suggesting that economic shocks—beyond infection dynamics—contributed to fertility suppression and underscoring the importance of economic support during public health crises.

April 2024 – present  **Doctor of Philosophy, Kyoto University,** Graduate School of Advanced Integrated Studies in Human Survivability (five-year doctoral program)

**Major in Interdisciplinary Studies (Data Science, Public Health, Child Welfare, etc.)**

- **Doctoral Research | Child Maltreatment Risk Screening via Dental & Lifestyle Data**
    - Title: Early Risk Estimation of Child Maltreatment Using Dental Checkup and Lifestyle Data: Model Development and Pathways to Implementation
    - Built an early screening model using integrated dental examination and lifestyle data from ~2,480 children in temporary protective custody. Focused on dental neglect indicators (caries, gingivitis, poor oral hygiene) as potential early signals of broader maltreatment subtypes. Applied statistical testing, multinomial logistic regression, and machine-learning methods (e.g., random forests) to capture nonlinear interactions and latent risk patterns, emphasizing interpretability (feature-importance visualization) to support practical use by dentists and child welfare professionals. Future work will expand to socioeconomic and household context variables and physical findings for more comprehensive risk profiling.

## **Research Projects**

### **Lead Research: Quantifying Child Maltreatment Risk through Multi-sector Data Integration**

**Aim:** Build quantitative evidence to support 

**(1)** refined risk stratification and classification

**(2)** design of **field-deployable decision-support tools**

**(3)** evidence for prevention policy and practice

**Approach:** Integrate multi-professional / multi-institutional datasets and apply statistical modeling and machine learning for interpretable, actionable insights.

**Project 1. Dental Examination × Lifestyle Habits × Maltreatment Classification (Children in Temporary Protective Custody)**

- **Role:** **Project Lead** (PI under supervision): Study design, data management, statistical/ML analysis, stakeholder coordination, manuscript preparation.
- **Data:** Reasons for protection, demographics, dental examination findings; subset includes lifestyle questionnaire data.
- **Methods:** Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, multinomial logistic regression, Random Forest, Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
- **Objective/Impact:** Clarify associations between oral health conditions and maltreatment classification to support earlier detection and rapid response; extendable to analyze lifestyle patterns and their links with oral environments.

**Project 2. Retrospective Evaluation of Child Abuse Assessments Using Clinical Forensic Medicine**

- **Role:** Data Analysis Lead: preprocessing, statistical/ML analysis, figures/tables, drafting Methods/Results
- **Goal:** Evaluate whether clinical forensic medicine improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making in suspected maltreatment.
- **Design:** Retrospective review of maltreated/suspected-maltreatment cases assessing background risk, clinical findings, testing, consultations, and outcomes.
- **Key variables:** (1) patient background, (2) suspected maltreatment type, (3) injury presence/location, (4) tests and specialty consultations, (5) integrated assessment, (6) disposition/management decision, etc.
- **Expected contribution:** Provide evidence for feasibility and implementation of clinical forensic evaluation pathways in a university hospital setting.

**Project 3 (Planned). National Child Abuse Registry Analysis**

- **Role:** Analyst as a member of the Research Committee, Japanese Society of Child Abuse and Neglect Medicine.
- **Scope:** Multi-center case aggregation to expand evidence on risk factors, clinical findings, responses, and outcomes.
- **Objective:** Develop generalizable evidence including rare/complex cases that are difficult to capture in single-site studies.

### **Collaborative Projects: Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Mathematical Modeling, and Measurement Analytics**

**Theme:** Quantify effectiveness and limitations of interventions for public health challenges via applied data analysis and methodological development.

**Project 1. Effectiveness of Airport Fever Screening (Okinawa, 2020–2022)**

- **Role:** Data Analysis : data visualization
- **Design:** Retrospective evaluation of fever screening using thermography across nine airports.
- **Findings:** Detection sensitivity for infected travelers peaked at **8.2%**, implying >90% missed under fever-only screening.
- **Recommendation:** Standalone temperature screening provides limited border control benefit; add measures such as pre-boarding testing depending on epidemic conditions.

**Project 2. Long-term Care Facilities in Okinawa: Infection Control Practices and Outbreak Size**

- **Role:** Data Analysis Lead: preprocessing, statistical analysis, figures/tables, contributed to manuscript writing
- **Design:** Questionnaire-based cross-sectional study of facilities with outbreaks (Apr–Jun 2022).

- **Key findings:** Smaller outbreaks associated with contact-based staff testing (**aRR 0.11**) and resident mask wearing (**aRR 0.40**).
- **Implication:** Risk-based testing may outperform fixed-interval screening strategies in resource-constrained settings.

**Project 3. Infectious Disease Mathematical Modeling: Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM)**

- **Role:** Data Analysis Lead: data collecting, preprocessing, statistical analysis, figures/tables, contributed to manuscript writing
- **Objective:** Infer data-driven interactions among infectious diseases (interference/co-circulation) from time series.
- **Methods:** EDM to estimate causal coupling, strength, and directionality.
- **Output:** Quantified interaction structure to prioritize interventions and anticipate concurrent epidemics.

**Project 4. Post-Earthquake Importation Risk of Infectious Diseases Using Mobility Data**
