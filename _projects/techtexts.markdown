[From the website](https://clarkdatalabs.github.io/techandtexts/fall2017):

Tech and Texts is an open seminar/workshop hosted by the University of Michigan Library to explore applied technology and theory. This semester our focus will be on text analysis. Over the course of the Fall 2017 semester we will meet every other Wednesday from 10:30am - 12:00pm to discuss, explore and experiment with various computational textual analysis technologies and theoretical texts. Meetings will be held in the Clark Library Presentation Space (2 South Hatcher).

Meetings are open to anyone at any skill level. It is not necessary to attend all meetings; please join us as you have time and interest. The text discussions will include a brief introduction to the reading. Tech explorations will be an open format for experimentation and shared learning (please bring a laptop). If you have any questions about the series you can contact Justin Joque (joque@umich.edu) or Alix Keener (alixkee@umich.edu).
